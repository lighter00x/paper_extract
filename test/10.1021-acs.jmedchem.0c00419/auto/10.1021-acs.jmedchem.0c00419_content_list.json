        "text": "ABSTRACT: Calcium dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) is an essential Ser/Thr kinase that controls invasion and egress by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The Gly gatekeeper of CDPK1 makes it exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by small molecule 1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-4-amine (PP) compounds that are bulky ATP mimetics. Here we rationally designed, synthesized, and tested a series of novel PP analogs that were evaluated for inhibition of CDPK1 enzyme activity in vitro and parasite growth in cell culture. Optimal substitution on the PP scaffold included 2-pyridyl ethers directed into the hydrophobic pocket and small carbocyclic rings accessing the ribose-binding pocket. Further optimization of the series led to identification of the lead compound 3a that displayed excellent potency, selectivity, safety profile, and efficacy in vivo. The results of these studies provide a foundation for further work to optimize CDPK1 inhibitors for the treatment of acute and chronic toxoplasmosis. ",

        "text": "Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread parasite of domestic, companion, and wild animals that also frequently causes infections in humans.1 The organism’s life cycle involves an acute phase dominated by rapidly growing tachyzoite stages that proliferate and disseminate widely within the body.2 Following a vigorous immune response, the parasite differentiates into a semidormant state characterized by tissue cysts that contain bradyzoites, which replicate slowly and asynchronously.3 Although the turnover of the chronic tissue stages is not precisely understood, available evidence suggests that there are successive waves of cysts that are formed, expand slowly, and rupture to release bradyzoites.4 The majority of these released stages are destroyed by the adaptive immune response, and yet they give rise to daughter cysts such that the chronic infection is perpetuated. When ingested by members of the cat family, bradyzoites can initiate development of the sexual phase within enterocytes of the gut resulting in shedding of oocysts in the feces.5 Oocysts are highly persistent in the environment and serve as a source of infection for many species of intermediate hosts including rodents and domestic animals.2 Because T. gondii infection occurs commonly in food animals, it poses a risk to food safety and animal well being.

        "text": "Humans become infected with T. gondii by ingestion of tissue cysts in undercooked meat or oocyst contaminated food or water.6 Most human infections give rise to mild illness that is effectively controlled by the immune response; however, toxoplasmosis poses a serious risk to the immunocompromised and due to congenital infection.7 The severity of toxoplasmosis is related to the fact that tachyzoites disseminate to all organs and readily form tissue cysts within neurons in the brain and endothelial cells in the retina.7 When these chronic infections reactivate due to decreased immunity, the tachyzoite forms reemerge and proliferate rapidly to cause encephalitis and retinitis, respectively.8 Hence, drugs must readily cross the blood−brain barrier in order to be effective in control of toxoplasmosis. Current therapy for toxoplasmosis relies on inhibition of the folate pathway with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine.9 Complications from this treatment include intolerance to sulfa drugs, intolerance of pyrimethamine due to gastrointestinal distress, and the potential for bone marrow suppression that requires coadministration of leucovorin (i.e., folic acid).10 Although the current standard of care can suppress active infection due to proliferation of tachyzoites, it has no effect on the semidormant bradyzoite forms.10a Although there are backup treatments that can be used in the event of toxicity (i.e., clindamycin, atovaquone, azithromycin), they are also unable to cure chronic infection.9 Consequently, those at risk of toxoplasmosis need to be treated for long-term, which is particularly problematic for the immunocompromised or newborns. As such, there is a need to develop new treatments with an improved safety profile and that would target the bradyzoites stages that are responsible for infection. ",

Having identified the $\\mathrm{CF}_{3}$ group as preferred in the 4-position based on the combination of potency and stability, we next explored analogs with a diverse range of $\\mathbb{R}_{2}$ substitutions on the pyrazolo nitrogen (Table 3). We focused on carbocycles and nonaromatic heterocycles (5 and 6) and found that cyclopropyl (3a), cyclobutyl (7a, Table 4), cyclopentyl (5a, Table 3), and cyclohexyl (5b, Table 3) rings were mostly similar in enzyme and cell activity, with CDPK1 $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ values of 16, 9.8, 23, and $15\\ \\mathrm{nM}_{;}$ respectively. However, cyclopropyl (3a) was clearly differentiated from the others with superior metabolic stability in both mouse and human liver microsomes. The comparable oxygen containing heterocyclic analogs 3-oxetain, 3-tetrahydrofuran, 4-tetrahydropyran, and 3-tetrahydropyran (5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, Table 3) had reduced and variable CDPK-1 potencies of 440, 48, 29, and $116\\mathrm{\\nM},$ , respectively. The nitrogen containing heterocyclic analogs 4-piperidine and 3-piperidine (5g, 5i, Table 3) showed similar decreased activity against the CDPK1 enzyme with $\\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ values of 68 and $57~\\mathrm{nM}$ . One important piece of SAR was determined by comparing 4-piperidine ${\\mathfrak{s g}}$ to 3,3-gem-difluoro4-piperidine analog 5h. The difluoro analog was predicted to reduce the $\\mathsf{p}K_{\\mathrm{a}}$ of the piperidine ring nitrogen from a calculated value of 9.2 to 7.1 and thus hypothesized to improve cell penetration and potency. As predicted, 5h showed a 10-fold increase in growth inhibition, although some of this improvement is likely due to its 3-fold increase in enzyme inhibition potency. Unfortunately, this strategy was not successful for 3-piperidine 5i when compared to 3,3-gemdifluoro-5-piperidine 5j, which was ${>}3$ -fold less potent in growth inhibition. In contrast to the heterocycles, those rings appended externally with an oxygen or nitrogen largely retained enzyme inhibition with varied effects on growth inhibition and metabolic stability. The most promising results were obtained with either the four-membered or six-membered rings. Some representative examples include the 4-position cis and trans cyclohexyl alcohols 6c and 6b (Table 3), respectively. Both of these analogs had good enzyme and growth inhibition plus excellent half-life in human microsomes but only moderate stability in the mouse microsomes. Appending a methylene spacer between the ring and alcohol (6d, 6e, Table 3) had a negative effect on the stability, while methylation of the alcohols (6f, 6g, Table 3) decreased potency 2- to 3-fold without improvement in mouse microsome stability. However, 2-hydroxycyclohexanes (6j, Table 3) fared better, maintaining potency with increased mouse microsome half-life, which was largely dependent upon the stereochemistry with optimal substitution being trans and with the $^{R,R}$ stereochemistry as with 6j. 2-Hydroxycyclohexane stereoisomers $\\mathbf{6k}$ and 6i were of substantially weaker activity. The absolute stereochemistry was determined by small molecule X-ray crystallography (Figure 2). Compound 6j had an $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ of $77~\\mathrm{nM}$ in the growth inhibition assay in addition to ${>}145$ min half-life in human and $66~\\mathrm{min}$ half-life in mouse microsomes. Likewise, amino substituted cycloalkyls largely showed good inhibition of enzyme and growth but interestingly were somewhat dependent on relative and absolute stereochemistry. For example, comparison of cis-3- aminocyclopentane $\\left(6\\mathbf{m}\\right)$ to the trans isomer (6l) shows that the cis form was more potent in enzyme inhibition and also had excellent stability in human microsomes and a moderate 84 min half-life in mouse liver microsomes. A similar trend is noted for the 4-methylaminocyclohexyl versions as seen with 6n and 6o where the cis isomer 6n is also $3\\times$ more potent in growth inhibition (Table 3). The dimethyl analog 6q and the desmethyl analog 6p both had similar enzyme and growth inhibition plus ${>}145$ min half-life in human microsomes but only 17 and $55\\ \\mathrm{min}$ half-life in the mouse liver microscome assay, respectively. Other issues were identified with these promising amino carbocycles including cellular efflux as indicated from the MDCK permeability assay and thus potentially poor CNS permeability and low oral bioavailability.

In order to estimate the potential metabolic stability of the top leads in different species, we compared the metabolism in liver microsomes from mouse, rat, rabbit, minipig, and dog. Compound 3a showed low metabolism in mouse, rat, and minipig, with higher levels in dog and rabbit, relative to the normal single pass rate of clearance due to hepatic circulation (Table S2). Compound 10c showed low metabolic clearance in microsomes for all species (Table S2). Compound 6j showed high metabolism in mouse but was stable in the other species (Table S2). Because these in vitro assays only estimate the potential for clearance in vivo, we also performed pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis over an $^{8\\mathrm{{h}}}$ time course following a single $10~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ oral dose vs $3\\mathrm{mg/}$ kg iv dose. We chose mouse for these studies since this species is the most versatile model for showing efficacy against toxoplasmosis. Compounds 3a and 10c showed similar maximum concentration in plasma $\\left(C_{\\mathrm{max}}\\right)$ and area under the curve (AUC) values, although 3a had a slightly longer half-life (Table 12). By comparison, 6j showed high clearance and corresponding lower $C_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and plasma AUC. All three compounds showed moderate to high bioavailability $(\\%~F)$ and high unbound fractions in plasma and in brain and importantly exhibited favorable CNS/plasma ratios indicating they are brain penetrant (Table 12). Finally, compounds 3a and 10c showed no adverse effects when dosed at $600~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ for 7 consecutive days in mouse (data not shown). Although we have not performed any studies on the safety of PP compounds during pregnancy, prevention of congenital infection is an important unmet medical need. Hence, future studies warrant evaluation of these compounds for safety and efficacy in congenital transmission models of toxoplasmosis. ",

We inoculated mice ip with 3000 tachyzoites of the RH strain, which is the equivalent of $>1000$ times the lethal dose34 (Figure 5A). Infection was tracked using bioluminescence from a firefly luciferase expressing strain of the parasite.35 Following infection, the parasites amplified rapidly and spread to all of the major organs, leading to a strong luciferase signal in the peritoneum (Figure 5A). Treatments of mice with a total daily dose of $60~\\mathrm{mg/kg},$ po, of 3a using different dosing paradigms of $60~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ once a day (QD), $30~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ twice a day (BID), or $15~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ four times per day (QID) for a total of 7 days were all effective at reducing parasite expansion and dissemination, as shown by bioluminescence measurements (Figure 5C) and prevention of death in the majority of animals (Figure 5D). To determine if animals were cured by treatment, the brain and lungs of surviving animals were homogenized and inoculated into recipient naïve animals that were subsequently followed without additional drug treatment. Because this strain is highly virulent in mice, inoculation of even a single parasite of the type I RH strain is expected to lead to death in the recipient.34 Bioluminescence imaging and survival assays revealed that all of the animals inoculated with tissues from mice treated 60 $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ QD succumbed to infection, whereas $20\\%$ of those inoculated with tissues from mice treated with $30~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ BID and $15~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ QID survived (Figure 5D). For these results, we conclude that more frequent dosing at lower concentration provides equal protection from survival and greater frequency of cure. ",

        "text": "Efficacy in the Immunocompromised Mouse Model. One of the key target populations for treatment of toxoplasmosis is immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV infection that have developed AIDS.36 To simulate this defect in the murine model, we used a previously described immunocompromised mouse that lacks IFN-γ receptors and hence is unable to control infection with a type II strain of the parasite, which is less virulent and prone to developing chronic infection in wild type mice.20 On the basis of the PK studies and efficacy in immune competent mice described above, we reasoned that higher doses would likely be required for control in the absence of a functional immune system. As such, we tested the PK in mice following an oral dose of 60, 90, or 120 $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ twice daily over a $24\\mathrm{h}$ period. Analysis of plasma levels indicate that the compound reached a peak that exceeded the $\\mathrm{EC}_{90}$ (free concentration) but that the concentration dropped below the $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ by 8 or $12\\mathrm{~h~}$ (Figure 6B). To compare the efficacy of these doses in preventing reactivation of toxoplasmosis, we treated immunocompromised mice using the model described in Figure 6A. Ifngr1 $^{-/-}$ mice were orally infected with tissue cysts of the type 2 strain ME49 expressing firefly luciferase and maintained by treatment with sulfadiazine, which suppresses tachyzoite growth but does not affect the development of tissue cysts.37 All inoculated animals became infected as shown by visible signs of illness and verified by positive ELISA titer at 3 weeks postinfection (Figure S1A). At 22 days postinfection, treatment with sulfadiazine was discontinued, and $^{48\\mathrm{~h~}}$ later the animals were treated with compound 3a at $60~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ by oral gavage BID for 8 or 21 days. Control animals lost weight and succumbed to infection by day 12 (Figure 6C,D). Animals treated with $60~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ for 8 days eventually succumbed to infection, although they lasted significantly longer than controls (Figure 6D). Treatment with $60\\mathrm{\\mg/kg}$ for 21 days led to significantly prolonger survival, and two animals survived beyond 30 days (Figure 6D), after which they gained weight (Figure 6C), suggesting they were cured of infection. The brain of these surviving animals was homogenized and injected into recipient $\\mathrm{Ifngr1^{-/-}}$ mice that were not treated with compound. These recipient animals, which are normally highly susceptible and unable to control infection, remained seronegative (Figure S1B,C), confirming that the donor mice had been cured during treatment. In a follow-up study, we repeated this trial using animals that were treated with 60, 90, or $120~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ BID for 8 days (Figure S2). The survival of mice treated for 8 days with either 60, 90, or $120~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ was similar, while greater survival was achieved with treatment at $60~\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ for 21 days (Figure 6E). Collectively, these findings indicate that the efficacy of 3a is driven primarily by total time of exposure over an extended time period. This result may reflect the fact that CDPK1 inhibitors are expected to act to block egress and invasion but may not have an effect on bradyzoites while they are intracellular. ",
